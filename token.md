# Buy VIBE

**Important:** VIBE is a community access token for vibe‑coding activities, not an investment product. Buying or holding VIBE does **not** give you equity, profit rights, or any guarantee of value. Only use funds you can afford to lose, and do your own research.

## Contract address

To interact with VIBE directly on Solana, use this contract address:

**VIBE Contract Address:**  
`FWAUjiMZv4Hh6CR8m8m6QGb1k5hkhxWHHZ2ewXVTpump`

Always double‑check the address in multiple sources before sending any funds.

## Buying VIBE via Pump.fun

You can connect a Solana wallet (such as Phantom) and buy VIBE on Pump.fun:

2. Connect your Solana wallet.
3. Confirm you see the **exact** VIBE contract address before swapping.
4. Complete the swap with a small test amount first if you are new to the platform.

## Risks and responsibility

Buying or holding VIBE involves the same risks as other Solana tokens: smart‑contract risk, volatility, liquidity risk, and potential total loss. There is no guarantee of liquidity or secondary market. You are solely responsible for your decisions and for complying with laws in your jurisdiction.
